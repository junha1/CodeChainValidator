# CodeChainValidator
Hello! I'm Junha Yang, core developer at [CodeChain](https://github.com/CodeChain-io/codechain) team.

I'm running valdiator node for CodeChain mainnet, and prepared to serve your delegation!
If you're interested to participating in CodeChain's staking, this will be a good chance to start it by delegating your stake to me!
